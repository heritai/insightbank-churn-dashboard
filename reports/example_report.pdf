This is a placeholder for an example report that would be generated by the InsightBank dashboard.

In a real implementation, this would contain:
- Executive summary of customer segmentation findings
- Churn prediction model performance metrics
- Business recommendations for each customer segment
- ROI analysis of retention strategies
- Implementation roadmap for customer success teams

The report would be automatically generated based on the current data and analysis results.
